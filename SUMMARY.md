# Automating Workflows with the Model Context Protocol (MCP)

This document summarizes the concepts demonstrated in the `mcp-server-fav-recipes` project and the accompanying blog post, "MCP Prompts: Building Workflow Automation." It outlines how the Model Context Protocol (MCP) can be used to create powerful, context-aware AI-driven automations.

## The Problem: Repetitive, Time-Consuming Tasks

Many workflows involve repetitive tasks that, while not complex, are time-consuming. Examples include generating weekly reports, updating documentation, or creating boilerplate code. MCP is designed to automate these tasks by providing a structured way for AI models to interact with specific data and tools.

## Core Components of MCP

The automation is achieved through three core components:

### 1. Resource Templates

In MCP, a **resource** is a piece of content with a unique URI. Instead of defining each resource statically (e.g., `file://recipes/italian.md`, `file://recipes/mexican.md`), which is not scalable, MCP uses **resource templates**.

A resource template uses a parameterized URI pattern to represent a dynamic set of resources. For example, the template `file://recipes/{cuisine}` can represent recipes for any number of cuisines. The server can then resolve a specific URI like `file://recipes/italian` to return the corresponding data. This approach is highly flexible and can be used for various data sources, including files, databases, and APIs.

### 2. Completions

To make automations user-friendly, MCP includes a **completions** feature. When a user needs to provide a parameter (like the `cuisine` in the example), the server can provide a list of valid suggestions as they type. This eliminates guesswork and makes the system more intuitive to use. Completions are provided by the server, ensuring a consistent experience across different client applications (e.g., VS Code, command-line tools).

### 3. Prompts

A **prompt** in MCP is the entry point for an automation. It's more than just a simple command; it's a sophisticated operation that combines user instructions with specific, context-aware data.

A prompt can evolve from a simple, static instruction:
`"Create a meal plan for a week"`

To a parameterized one:
`"Create a meal plan for a week using {cuisine} cuisine"`

And finally, to a rich, context-aware command that includes **resources**. This is the key to powerful automation. Instead of relying on the AI's general knowledge, the prompt can bundle the user's instructions with their own data (e.g., a personal collection of recipes). The AI then uses this specific context to generate a tailored response.

## Example: The Meal Planning Automation

The `mcp-server-fav-recipes` project demonstrates these concepts with a practical example: a weekly meal planner.

1.  **Resource Template:** It uses a `file://recipes/{cuisine}` resource template to serve recipes for different cuisines.
2.  **Completions:** It provides completions for the `cuisine` parameter, suggesting available cuisines as the user types.
3.  **Prompt:** It registers a `weekly-meal-planner` prompt that takes a `cuisine` as input. When executed, the prompt provides the AI with:
    *   A set of instructions to create a 7-day meal plan, a shopping list, and preparation tips.
    *   The actual recipe content for the selected cuisine, attached as a resource.

This ensures the AI generates a meal plan based on the user's specific recipes, not generic ones.

## Broader Implications and Extensibility

The patterns demonstrated in the meal planning example can be applied to a wide range of domains:

*   **Documentation Generation:** A prompt could access source code as a resource to generate up-to-date documentation.
*   **Report Creation:** An automation could pull data from various APIs and databases to create a weekly business report.
*   **Development Workflows:** A prompt could generate boilerplate code, run tests, and format the output based on the project's structure.

MCP's modular, server-based architecture also allows for more complex automations, such as **prompt chains** (where the output of one prompt becomes the input for another) and **cross-server workflows** that combine capabilities from multiple servers.

By connecting AI with structured, context-specific data, MCP provides a powerful framework for building meaningful and efficient workflow automations.
